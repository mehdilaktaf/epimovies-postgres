# Getting started with Epimovies Server
This server holds a REST API working with PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases.  

This project was created using :
    - nodejs (https://github.com/nodejs/node)
    - express (https://github.com/expressjs/express)
    - sequelize (https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize)
    - postgres (https://github.com/postgres/postgres)
    - and more...

## Starting the server

In the project directory, you can run:

### `nodemon index` OR `node index` 
 
This will run the server locally on your machine.\
Open **[http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)** to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. (if you used nodemon)\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Documentation & Usage

Now that your server is running you can explore our API.\

**Note: most of the API will require you to be authenticated first. You can create an account on this page [http://localhost:5000/auth/sign-up](http://localhost:5000/auth/sign-up).**
